Bottom up traversal:
Essentially means incrementing a number made by interleaving the bits of x and y co-ordinates: like a space-filling curve.
Would allow fast construction by merging with minimal temporary nodes.

On checking, unsurprisingly this already exists (Morton Number (number theory)).
See: graphics.standford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html for some methods.

Dimensions: would 16bits for x and y coordinates be enough?
Map dimension of 65536x65536
Depends on screen and character scale.
128x128 512 pixel square screens
64x128 1024x512px ultra-widescreen screens

1024x512 is a pretty kicking rad screen size, tbh.

Prototypes to write:
Interactive construction/destruction with dynamic quadtree modification
Collision tests for circles, AABBs, other primitives(?)
