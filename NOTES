Bottom up traversal:
Essentially means incrementing a number made by interleaving the bits of x and y co-ordinates: like a space-filling curve.
Would allow fast construction by merging with minimal temporary nodes.

On checking, unsurprisingly this already exists (Morton Number (number theory)).
See: graphics.standford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html for some methods.
